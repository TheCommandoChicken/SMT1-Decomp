# SMT1-Decomp
A very WIP decompilation of Shin Megami Tensei 1 for the Playstation.

### Note that this will not compile into a playable game on its own, and that much of the code is undocumented and unorganized for the present.

## Why?
- The classic SMT games (with the exception of 1) have yet to be released in the west, and none of them have been re-released on PC, even via an emulated release.
- The goal of this project is not strictly to obtain a codebase that recompiles into the original executable with no differences, but rather to simply reverse engineer the code enough that a PC port of the three classic games (SMT1, SMT2, and If...) can be made, with optional enhancements that would be difficult to implement as a hack.
- That being said, those who _are_ interested in code matching are welcome to contribute to this repo.
- The other reason for this project is that I have a personal interest in these games, and wanted to learn more about how they work under the hood.
## Contributing
For right now there is no proper workflow to get a development environment set up. If you do want to contribute to the project, then you will need to acquire the original game files on your own (do not ask me for them), as well as setting up the PsyQ SDK, which will require you run it on a 32-bit machine. If you have the knowledge necessary to improve this workflow then feel free to open an issue or make a pull request.
## Building
Building is unsupported right now.
